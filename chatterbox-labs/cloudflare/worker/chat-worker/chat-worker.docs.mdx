description: A very basic Cloudflare worker

Cloudflare Workers are serverless applications most often used to intercept and modify network requests (much like Service Workers in the browser).

This CF Worker sets a function to be triggered on a 'fetch' event. The function returns a [Response](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/response),
containing `data.hello: 'world'`.

To see this worker deployed, head over to: [teambit.cloud/chat-worker](https://teambit.cloud/chat-worker)

To run the app (worker) locally, run the following command:

```
bit run chat-worker-worker
```

The output should display the port for the locally running app, like so:

```
chat-worker-worker app is running on http://localhost:3000
```
